The theremin consists of two metal antennas that sense the relative position of the thereminist's hands and control pitch of the notes with one hand, and volume with the other. Later the inventor, Leo Theremin, proposed another musical instrument -- terpsitone -- named after the Greek Goddess of dance Terpsihore. The idea was that sound can be generated by sensing the body of dancer. It was proposed to be made on the same tracking principles as the theremin except that it was designed as a platform on which the dancer had to move/dance. This instrument however never was really made except a few test copies due to the complexity of tracking and using.

67,CCDS25-0078,Faith and Fate: The Role of Noise in Web Agents,"The rapid proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, particularly those operating solely on the User Interface (UI) level, has significantly enhanced user interaction with the web, offering unparalleled accessibility and automation. However, this transformative technology introduces novel security challenges, especially since the majority of current research focuses on the increasingly prevalent UI-only paradigm. This paper investigates the dual role of ``noise'' – web elements imperceptible or irrelevant to humans but interpretable by UI-only agents – in both protecting and exploiting these agents. We explore two primary scenarios: ``Faith,'' where noise is strategically employed to prevent unauthorized agent actions like automated data scraping, and ``Fate,'' where noise is leveraged to mislead agents into performing malicious actions, such as clicking hidden advertisements or downloading malware. We delve into shallow attack techniques that exploit these vulnerabilities, demonstrating how subtle webpage modifications can manipulate the behavior of UI-only agents. Simultaneously, we propose deeper defense mechanisms that leverage an understanding of agent perception to mitigate these risks, focusing on both action generation and action grounding processes. We further analyze a case study of stealthy traffic redirection, where agents are subtly guided towards malicious content while the user remains unaware. This work aims to establish guiding principles for designing secure web agent interactions, emphasizing the need to balance usability with robust security measures in the face of evolving web threats, particularly within the context of UI-only agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for a paradigm shift in web security to address the unique challenges posed by the increasing prevalence of LLM-based, UI-only web agents, ensuring their responsible development and deployment.

68,CCDS25-0079,"Benchmarking User Vulnerability to LLM-Driven Attacks: A User Study on Perceptions, Susceptibility, and Mitigation Strategies","abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various sectors, from research to programming, enhancing productivity and facilitating complex tasks. However, this reliance on LLMs also exposes users to a range of potential threats, including phishing, misinformation, and social engineering attacks. This study investigates the vulnerability of users to LLM-driven attacks, exploring how different factors such as technical proficiency, trust in AI, and task complexity influence their susceptibility. We present an interactive framework designed to simulate and evaluate a variety of LLM-driven attacks, focusing on phishing, misleading content, and malicious code injection. Through a controlled user study involving diverse participants, we benchmark their responses to these attacks, assessing the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies. The study also examines the role of real-time feedback mechanisms, user education, and interface design in enhancing user resistance to deceptive LLM outputs. Our findings shed light on how user behaviors, demographics, and environmental factors impact the likelihood of falling victim to LLM-driven threats, providing valuable insights for the development of more robust security measures and user awareness programs. This research contributes to the growing body of work on AI safety and user protection in the context of emerging AI technologies.

69,CCDS25-0080,Secure and Private Data Valuation for Large Models,"In the era of large language models (LLMs), high-quality data has become a valuable commodity, with companies increasingly collecting, curating, and synthesizing datasets for sale. However, a major challenge in the data marketplace is that buyers cannot assess the true effectiveness of the data before making a purchase, leading to trust issues and inefficiencies. To address this, we need a novel framework for private data valuation that enables fair pricing and verification without exposing sensitive information or undermining the profits of both buyers and sellers.

However, existing methods for evaluating watermark robustness are insufficient. Current research primarily tests proposed watermarking methods against simple attacks like re-watermarking, de-watermarking, and random removal, which fail to provide a comprehensive assessment of robustness. A key task is to design effective code watermark attacks that exploit the unique properties of watermarks (e.g., grammar, semantic) and integrate these attacks into a unified framework to thoroughly evaluate the robustness of code watermarks.

A recent benchmarking study revealed that the semi-automatic approach adopted by DBLP is the state-of-the-art. However, homonymous author name disambiguation remains an unyielding problem in DBLP. Recently, we have developed a novel system called NERD to take a concrete step towards addressing this problem. We formalize this problem in DBLP as the namesake discovery problem (NDP) and present a light-weight and fast solution to address it. Specifically, it exploits an external data source (i.e., OpenAlex) and deploys a non-machine learning-based solution to identify namesakes hidden in a DBLP page associated with an author name. The goal of this project is to undertake exhaustive, rigorous, and systematic analysis of the results quality of NERD. To this end, real-world DBLP pages shall be used to analyze NERD’s ability to identify many namesakes accurately.

Traditionally, PC chairs take a “manual” approach to form a PC. In practice, however, such an approach, might not create a diverse PC w.r.t. certain dimensions. Furthermore, it has been reported that the traditional manual approach may lead to dense coauthorship networks among PC members. All these aspects can easily make it challenging in practice to ensure fair and quality assignments of reviewers to submissions.

163,CCDS25-0177,Personalized Economic Decision-Making in Multi-Agent Simulations Using LLM-based Agents,"Economic decision-making is inherently diverse, influenced by individual personalities and cognitive biases. Traditional economic models often assume homogeneous agents who make decisions based on fixed rationality principles, which limits their ability to capture the diverse of economic decision-making. Recently, large language models (LLMs) shows its ability in simulating different personalities. Therefore, LLM-based agents can exhibit individualized decision-making patterns, adapt their economic strategies, and dynamically respond to market conditions. By integrating personality-driven reasoning and contextual adaptability, LLM-powered agents can simulate diverse consumer behaviours, investment strategies, and negotiation dynamics, leading to more realistic and insightful economic simulations. The objective of this project is to explore personalized economic decision-making using LLM-based agents. Specifically, we will design agents with distinct economic personas, allowing them to trade, negotiate, and respond to market fluctuations in a multi-agent simulation environment. By analysing how different decision-making strategies influence market, we aim to uncover insights into the role of heterogeneity in economic systems. By simulating personalized economic decision-making behaviours, this project will contribute to more realistic and human-like economic simulations.

164,CCDS25-0178,Pandemic Spread Prediction with Deep Learning,"Accurate prediction of pandemic spread is essential for effective public health. Traditional epidemiological models, such as the SEIR model, rely on predefined assumptions that often limit their adaptability to real-world dynamics, making long-term forecasting challenging. Recent advancements in deep learning offer a data-driven approach to pandemic prediction, enabling models to learn patterns directly from historical data. Unlike traditional models, deep learning-based approaches can dynamically adjust to changing conditions and improve prediction accuracy over time. By integrating deep learning with real-world pandemic data, we can develop more robust forecasting models that enhance situational awareness and support timely interventions. The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning-based pandemic prediction model that improves forecasting accuracy by leveraging historical data. Specifically, we will train deep learning models, such as LSTM and Transformer-based architectures, to capture temporal dependencies in infection trends. By comparing the performance of deep learning models with traditional epidemiological models, we aim to evaluate their effectiveness in capturing real-world pandemic spread. This project will provide a more adaptive and data-driven approach to pandemic forecasting, contributing to more informed public health strategies and improved preparedness for future outbreaks.

165,CCDS25-0179,Simulating Negotiation and Trade Behaviour Using LLM-Powered Agents,"Negotiation and trade are fundamental components of economic systems, influencing market dynamics, pricing strategies, and resource allocation. Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) for economic simulations rely on predefined rules and fixed strategies, limiting their ability to capture the complexity and adaptability of real-world negotiations. These models struggle to simulate the flexibility, strategic reasoning, and language-based interactions that characterize human negotiation behaviour. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) provide an opportunity to enhance trade simulations by enabling agents to negotiate, persuade, and adapt dynamically. Unlike conventional ABM agents, LLM-powered agents can engage in context-aware, multi-turn negotiations, adjusting their offers and responses based on economic incentives, prior interactions, and negotiation history. The objective of this project is to develop a multi-agent negotiation and trade simulation framework using LLM-powered agents. Specifically, we will design agents that can engage in price bargaining, respond strategically to counteroffers, and optimize their trade outcomes in a simulated market environment. By analysing negotiation patterns, market fluctuations, and deal success rates, we aim to understand how AI-driven agents can mimic human negotiation behaviour.

179,CCDS25-0193,Voice-Activated LLM-Powered Conversational Health Companion for Smartwatches,"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with smartwatch data aims to create conversational health companions that provide personalized health insights. Recent studies have explored this integration to enhance user engagement and health monitoring. For instance, the development of PhysioLLM demonstrates how LLMs can process physiological data from wearables to offer tailored health advice. Another study introduced a Personal Health Insights Agent (PHIA) that utilizes LLMs to analyze wearable data, providing users with actionable health information. However, both approaches rely primarily on text-based interaction, lacking voice-based engagement, which could improve usability, accessibility, and real-time feedback. Our research aims to bridge this gap by incorporating voice activation and voice-based interaction in LLM-powered health companions. Research Objective: This research collects physiological data (e.g., heart rate, sleep patterns, stress levels) from smartwatches using APIs and captures voice interactions for analysis. It integrates LLMs with automatic speech recognition (ASR) and wake-word activation to process voice commands for personalized health feedback. A conversational voice interface is developed, and comparative user studies assess engagement, usability, and adherence in voice vs. text-based interactions. How effectively can LLMs process and integrate both physiological data from smartwatches and voice inputs to generate real-time, personalized health insights? What is the impact of voice-based interaction on user engagement, usability, and adherence compared to text-based interactions in LLM-powered smartwatch health companions?

196,CCDS25-0210,Reducing Hallucinations in Large Language Models through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),"1. Background and Motivation Hallucinations in LLMs occur when the models produce outputs that are plausible but factually incorrect or fabricated. This issue is particularly concerning in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, finance, and education, where misinformation can lead to severe consequences. Current LLMs generate text based on patterns learned from large datasets during training, but they do not inherently verify the accuracy of the information they produce. RAG addresses this limitation by incorporating a retrieval mechanism that fetches relevant information from an external knowledge base or document repository, which the model can then use to inform its responses. By grounding the generation process in real-time, accurate data, RAG has the potential to significantly reduce hallucinations and improve the trustworthiness of LLM outputs. 2. Research Objectives The primary objectives of this research are: Develop and integrate a RAG framework that enhances the factual accuracy of LLM outputs by retrieving relevant information from external sources during text generation. Evaluate the effectiveness of the RAG framework in reducing hallucinations across various tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and dialogue systems. Explore the balance between retrieval and generation, optimizing the integration of retrieved content without compromising the fluency and coherence of the LLM's output. Conduct domain-specific evaluations to assess the impact of RAG in high-stakes fields, such as healthcare, legal technology (Legal Tech), and finance, where accuracy is critical.

This kind of problems are prevalent in real-world applications. There have been two main approaches to address the uncertainty in future inputs. One approach is to design online algorithms and benchmark their performance through competitive analysis against optimal offline solutions that have prior knowledge of the entire inputs. However, the resultant worst-case guarantees are usually very pessimistic without any assumptions on future inputs at all. Another approach is to train machine learning models with historical data to predict future inputs and then respond according to the predictions. But a major drawback is that this method often lacks provable performance guarantees. To overcome their respective disadvantages, a recent trend is to combine these two approaches by augmenting online algorithms with machine-learned predictions. The goal is to come up with algorithms having practical performance and theoretical guarantees improving with the quality of predictions and meanwhile staying bounded when predictions have large errors.

299,CCDS25-0313,RL-Free Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Human Value Alignment,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet ensuring that their outputs align with human values and societal norms remains a critical challenge. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise in achieving value alignment, it also faces limitations such as high training costs, low sample efficiency, and complex policy design. To address these concerns, we propose a multi-agent framework that does not rely on reinforcement learning. Instead, it establishes roles and interaction mechanisms among multiple LLM-based agents, combined with explicit constraints on human values and norms, and an iterative feedback loop to refine the outputs. Through multi-turn discussion, negotiation, and evaluation, this approach dynamically identifies and corrects potential misalignments, reducing training overhead and providing a new perspective on value alignment. Our framework offers a viable solution for high-stakes applications—such as education, healthcare, and legal systems—where safe and reliable alignment with human values is paramount, and opens new avenues for further research on LLM-based human value alignment.

300,CCDS25-0314,Privacy-Preserving Classification of Human vs. LLM-Generated Text: Mitigating Leakage Risks in Sensitive Contexts,"The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has blurred the boundaries between human and machine-generated content, creating critical needs for reliable classification systems. While existing research predominantly focuses on improving detection accuracy through advanced algorithms, these approaches often neglect the crucial dimension of privacy preservation – particularly problematic when handling sensitive texts containing personal identifiers, medical histories, or confidential business information. This study addresses the under-explored challenge of developing classification frameworks that simultaneously maintain detection efficacy and prevent privacy leakage during analysis processes. We identify three key vulnerabilities in conventional detection pipelines: 1) Exposure of raw text to third-party classifiers, 2) Traceability of analysis patterns that could reveal protected content, and 3) Absence of compliance mechanisms for regulated industries. Through systematic analysis of real-world scenarios involving healthcare documentation, legal contracts, and educational materials, we demonstrate how current state-of-the-art methods inadvertently expose sensitive information even while performing legitimate classification tasks. Our research establishes novel evaluation criteria for privacy-aware detection systems, emphasizing the balance between classification precision and information protection robustness. By formalizing threat models specific to text authorship attribution, we reveal fundamental tensions between feature extraction requirements and privacy constraints. The proposed framework contributes to AI safety research by providing methodological guidelines for implementing end-to-end protections without compromising detection utility, particularly crucial for applications governed by GDPR, HIPAA, and other data protection regulations.

360,CCDS25-0374,Machine Learning and Semantic Communication for Interference Management in Spectrum-Sharing Wireless Networks,"Semantic communication focuses on transmitting only the useful information of a message. Machine learning (ML) techniques play a pivotal role in semantic communication in extracting the meaningful information, such as identifying critical features in an image, key phrases in a text, or relevant sensor readings in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Over the years, the spectrum scarcity problem in wireless communication has become one of the most pressing challenges due to the surge in mobile phones and the rapid growth of connected devices, including smart home appliances, industrial machines, healthcare devices, and vehicles. To address this issue, spectrum-sharing technologies have emerged as a potential solution. These technologies allow multiple devices to share the same frequency bands. However, when a large number of devices operate within the same frequency band, they create interference for each other, reducing communication quality. This can lead to slower speeds, dropped connections, or even complete signal loss. Therefore, in spectrum-sharing environments, interference management is crucial to maintaining the required quality of service.

388,CCDS25-0402,The dynamic graph learning based on the spiking neural network,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently become increasingly popular due to their ability to learn complex systems of relations or interactions. Despite the plethora of different models for deep learning on graphs, few approaches have been proposed for dealing with graphs that are dynamic in nature (e.g. evolving features or connectivity over time). Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are the third-generation neural networks. Unlike conventional neural networks, SNNs transmit information via the precise timing (temporal) of spike trains consisting of a series of spikes (discrete), rather than a real value (continuous). Driven by the sparse nature of spike events and event-driven computation, SNNs offer exceptional power efficiency and are the preferred neural networks in neuromorphic architectures. Despite their excellent potential, SNNs have been limited to relatively simple tasks (e.g., image classification) and small datasets (e.g., MNIST and CIFAR), on a rather shallow structure. This project targets the probability of incorporating the SNNs into dynamic graph learning. On the one hand, this combination can help model the temporal data in graph use SNNs manner. On the other hand, it can also help reduce the energy consumption of graph learning. Specific details: (a) Design component (b) Implementation component The research component includes the basic GNN reference or prediction, the representation learning on dynamic graph, and the SNNs structure.

389,CCDS25-0403,Profiler for RocksDB,"RocksDB stands as a prevalent LSM-tree key-value store system, often serving as an embedded key-value store for various applications. Typically, RocksDB gathers statistical data, including operation execution times and internal event occurrences, and provides this information cumulatively through functions such as statistics.ToString or statistics.getHistogramString. While these functions deliver a comprehensive report up to the current point, the need often arises to analyze data within specific time windows or perform complex real-time calculations on internal events, a process known as stream processing. In industry settings, streaming systems like ElasticSearch, Prometheus, and Kafka are commonly employed to collect internal statistical data from database systems. This enables developers and database administrators (DBAs) to monitor events and computations dynamically in real-time. However, RocksDB faces limitations in this regard due to the absence of relevant interfaces. It can only accumulate statistical data in memory and process them in batch, posing challenges for real-time monitoring. Specific details: Your task is to implement a new class extending the Statistics interface in RocksDB which is able to: 1. Collect statistical data for internal events or operations 2.

444,CCDS25-0458,Exploring the use of generative AI techniques for brain decoding in brain disorders,"Brain decoding involves the interpretation of neural activity patterns, with the goal of understanding how information is represented in our brains. In the context of brain disorders, such representations are likely different due to disruptions to typical brain function. Traditionally, research on brain disorders involves training machine learning models on brain imaging datasets to classify between healthy and disorder states and identify potential imaging-based biomarkers. Recently, Generative AI tools have demonstrated the potential of widening the scope of brain decoding by incorporating additional modalities such as perception information (i.e. images, video, text, audio). This involves training generative models to reconstruct information shown to the person during the brain scan (e.g. snippets of video or audio from a movie). However, most of these recent advancements are limited to scans of healthy subjects.

445,CCDS25-0459,Models for Privacy-preserving Image Super-resolution.,"Learning based models are known to be susceptible to adversarial attacks, in which adding small perturbations in the clean input image will lead a classifier to make wrong predictions. Adversarial images usually bring threats to practical deep learning applications such as autonomous driving, safety surveillance, and intelligent healthcare. However, it has positive value in privacy-preserving applications, such as the application of photo sharing in social media toward cyber security. In this project, we will explore generative models to generate adversarial examples for Image super-resolution tasks.

However, due to the unique characteristics of 3D data, as well as the hard constraints from real-world applications, the research and adoption of 3D deep learning are currently facing many technical challenges such as high storage & computation costs, high power consumption, high latency, etc. This proposal aims to develop fundamental 3D deep learning data analysis techniques, specifically developing resource-efficient and energy-efficient 3D deep learning models to tackle the challenges occurred in current 3D models, such as huge memory & computation costs and huge power consumption, to make 3D deep learning more realistic for real-world applications. Objective: The primary goal of this research is to design novel compression algorithms (quantization, pruning, entropy coding, etc.) for state-of-the-art 3D deep learning models.

447,CCDS25-0461,Video quality assessment (VQA) modelling,"Recently, there has been tremendous growth in social media with a huge amount of videos being created and shared on media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and TikTok. It has been estimated that there are over 4 billion video views per day on Facebook and above 500 hours of videos uploaded per minute on YouTube. However, these videos may have low quality due to some factors such as motion blur, noise, distortion, focus issues, and shakiness. It would be of great value in studying video quality assessment (VQA) that predicts the perceived quality of the video as humans do, which could be used to eliminate low-quality videos or improve them during the acquisition and enhancement process. Due to the highly redundant nature of video content, proper feature extraction will speed up the VQA while maintaining accuracy. In addition, learning based on important features will also help to further improve the accuracy of a VQA model.

551,CCDS25-0567,Preserving Model Integrity: Addressing Security Challenges in Fine-Tuned LLMs,"The advent of LLMs, particularly those fine-tuned for downstream tasks, has significantly advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence in many domains. However, this fine-tuning process often leads to a loss of safety alignment, posing potential risks to security. The issue arises because LLMs, when adapted to specific tasks, may unintentionally drift away from their originally aligned protocols, making them vulnerable to adversarial prompting. This research addresses the challenge of maintaining robust safety alignment of LLMs after they undergo downstream task-specific fine-tuning. Our proposed solution is a novel post-training alignment strategy designed to resist the effects of downstream fine-tuning, focusing on identifying and safeguarding those model parameters that are crucial for security but often irrelevant to general task performance. By isolating and preserving these parameters, we aim to enhance the model’s ability to resist potential security threats without compromising its performance on downstream tasks. This study contributes to the field of AI safety by developing a strategy that helps ensure LLMs remain aligned with safety objectives, even in the face of domain-specific fine-tuning challenges.

552,CCDS25-0568,"Assessing Vulnerabilities in Reasoning-Driven LLMs: Attacks, Challenges, and Defensive Strategies","Reasoning-driven language models have emerged as a pivotal advancement in AI, demonstrating the ability to tackle complex tasks once considered beyond the reach of machine intelligence. As these models gain prominence, they are increasingly entrusted with critical decision-making processes, from high-stakes scientific analysis to strategic business planning. However, this growing reliance on reasoning LLMs also exposes them to a novel class of threats. Malicious actors can exploit the reasoning chain within these models, introducing subtle logical inconsistencies, propagating fabricated justifications, or manipulating intermediate thought processes to compromise outcomes. Such attacks may lead to erroneous conclusions, biased inferences, or hidden backdoors that undermine user trust. Moreover, the complexity of reasoning pipelines makes it challenging for end-users and developers to detect and mitigate these manipulations effectively. In this study, we investigate the susceptibility of reasoning-driven LLMs to attacks targeting their logical chains, exploring the factors that make them vulnerable and examining the implications of compromised reasoning on downstream tasks. We propose an evaluation framework designed to benchmark diverse attack vectors, encompassing targeted logic disruptions, adversarial prompts, and stealthy manipulations. Additionally, we introduce and assess various defensive strategies, such as robust training protocols, enhanced verification layers, and multi-agent cross-checking mechanisms. By addressing these challenges, our research offers critical insights into safeguarding reasoning LLMs, emphasizing the importance of trustworthy logical processes and laying the groundwork for future innovations in secure and transparent AI systems.

Thus, post-training quantization (PTQ) gains unprecedented attention due to its ability to significantly reduce computational and storage costs while almost maintaining model performance.

By incorporating safety and accuracy evaluation mechanisms, we achieve real-time evaluation of the model's alignment performance throughout the quantization process. Based on the evaluation results, our method dynamically adjusts quantization parameters and calibration dataset, achieving safety optimization through adversary. Additionally, our approach advances the explainability of PTQ safety by exposing and analyzing changes in the safety alignment during the quantization process.

746,CCDS25-0774,Gradient Estimation over Discrete Branches in Machine Learning Libraries,"Automatic differentiation (AD) [1] is a core feature of machine learning libraries like PyTorch [2], allowing efficient computation of gradients over complex computational graphs. However, although discrete branches (e.g., if-else constructs) are commonplace in real-world problems, gradients computed by standard AD techniques often do not reflect the effects of branches on the computed output. The recently proposed DiscoGrad Gradient Oracle (DGO) [3,4] combines AD and branch-level statistics to efficiently compute gradients over discrete branches. However, its implementation is currently limited to C++ programs. This project aims to explore how DGO can be adapted and implemented within PyTorch or an equivalent machine learning library, enabling gradient estimation over discrete branches in computational graphs. The goal is to extend the gradient computation capabilities and provide a robust solution for handling discrete decisions during training by integrating DGO's AD and stateful estimation techniques into the library's gradient estimations.

747,CCDS25-0775,Self-Calibrating Generative Agents,"Generative agents have been proposed as ""believable simulacra of human behavior"" [1]. Relying on the recent advances in large language models (LLMs), generative agents can form opinions, communicate among each other, follow daily routines, form plans, and remember previous experiences. The capability of generative agents to exhibit ""common sense"" reasoning makes them attractive for building believable and explainable models of human decision-making. On the other hand, many practical uses of models involving simulated humans, e.g., for studying build evacuations, must be shown to be valid based on the adherence of the simulated behavior to real-world empirical data. The goal of this Final Year Project is to bring the capabilities of generative agents to simulate human-like behavior together with the well-defined requirements of evacuation studies. In a self-calibration environment, agents will follow their own generated narrative, reasoning, and actions while interacting with simulated evacuation scenes formulated based on real-world experiments from the literature [2]. Automatic feedback from the simulated environment will allow for a gradual harmonization of the generated evacuations with physical constraints and the real-world observations without the need for user intervention.

748,CCDS25-0776,Comparing Thread Interaction Models for Discrete-Event Simulation on Graphics Processing Units,"Graphics processing units (GPUs) have become indispensable accelerators in most areas of scientific computing. One important application area is discrete-event simulation (DES) [1]. In DES, the state of a simulated system (e.g., a computer network or a manufacturing plant) evolves over time through a series of events that signify instantaneous changes in the system’s state. It has been shown that GPUs can accelerate DES substantially [2], but careful design of the data structures is required to efficiently support the fine-grained thread interactions induced by this class of simulations [3]. A recently proposed parallelized DES algorithm [4] targeting CPUs achieves high-efficiency thread interactions by fine-grained locking and shared memory accesses rather than the traditional message passing, thus significantly reducing the number of synchronization rounds and memory accesses. Due to the synchronous execution model and the substantial cost of memory accesses on GPUs, this approach holds significant promise for GPU-based DES. The objective of this Final Year Project is to compare message-based and lock-based thread interaction on GPUs both in isolation and when applied as part of a DES implementation. The overall performance is evaluated using a simple simulation model from epidemiology. References are available on request. Specific details: (a) Design component (b) Implementation component The comparison of the thread interaction models will take two approaches: first, the fundamental performance characteristics will be determined using micro-benchmarks on the basis of metrics such as instructions and cache misses per thread interaction. In a second step, the message-based and locking-based interaction will be implemented to execute a simple epidemiological model and assessed when applied to overall simulations.

749,CCDS25-0777,Speculative Parallel Simulation of Event-Driven Molecular Dynamics,"Discrete molecular dynamics models form the basis for important models for simulating ideal gases, granular materials, or even star and planet formations. Classically, these models are simulated by advancing the simulation time in steps of fixed size. This approach comes with substantial overhead due to the sparsity of collisions. The method of event-driven molecular dynamics avoids unnecessary computational steps by iteratively advancing to the time of the next inter-particle collision [1]. While more efficient, this approach requires careful updating of projected collision times. While several implementations have been proposed [2-4] , event-driven molecular dynamics on modern parallel architectures is still considered to be challenging [4]. The goal of this Final Year Project is to assess the suitability of different classes of parallel simulation algorithms for accelerating event-driven molecular dynamics simulations, and to derive recommendations for implementors in order to achieve highest performance on modern hardware.

While adversarial attacks on classification models (e.g., distinguishing cats from dogs) have been extensively studied, the vulnerability of regression models to such attacks remains under-researched. However, regression tasks play a critical role in safety-sensitive applications, including predictive maintenance, autonomous vehicle control, and financial forecasting. This project aims to analyze, implement, and benchmark state-of-the-art adversarial attacks and defense mechanisms designed for regression models.

809,CCDS25-0838,Programmatic Autoencoders in Reinforcement Learning​,"Learning meaningful feature representations is essential for efficiently processing high-dimensional inputs, such as images, particularly in reinforcement learning (RL) settings. While traditional autoencoders extract representations tailored to specific objectives, these representations often lack explicit semantic interpretability, limiting their generalization capabilities across diverse contexts. To address this limitation, we propose replacing the standard neural decoder with a programmatic decoder that leverages structured outputs from the encoder to perform tasks that help align the learned representations with concrete concepts. This approach enforces the encoder to produce semantically meaningful representations that are compatible with programmatic decoding, ensuring greater interpretability. Building on prior work [1], we plan to investigate differentiable programmatic decoder, enabling gradient-based optimization and improving sample efficiency. Furthermore, we plan to explore the integration of programmatic autoencoders within RL frameworks to enhance representation learning, ultimately improving policy generalization across diverse environments.

810,CCDS25-0839,Accelerating Diffusion Models with Sparse Consistency Model,"Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional image generation capabilities, but their widespread adoption is limited by significant computational demands and prolonged inference times. There are two prominent strategies to address these limitations: 1) employing consistency models to reduce inference steps; 2) using sparse attention to reduce the computation cost of the attention operation. However, these techniques have not yet been effectively combined within a single cohesive model. This project aims to integrate a sparse attention mechanism into a pre-trained latent consistency diffusion model, thereby accelerating inference while maintaining high-quality generation outputs. To explore the trade-off between computational efficiency and output quality, we will systematically evaluate how varying sparse attention parameters impact the generation results.

Meanwhile, studies in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the potential of inference-time scaling - devoting additional compute at inference to refine outputs - beyond the conventional approach of increasing dataset size and model capacity during training. This project aims at exploring inference-time scaling in diffusion-based T2I systems by employing a strong visual-language verifier to provide semantic feedback, guiding the model toward more faithful and detailed outputs.

While recent studies have demonstrated editing capabilities using segmentation results, these approaches rely on well-segmented meshes. However, most meshes have empty interiors, meaning that directly splitting segmented regions often leads to missing faces at the overlapped part and ambiguous boundaries. To address this, an additional reconstruction process is required for accurate segmentation and separation.

Moreover, ever since the introduction of COLMAP, there have been multiple numerical and deep-learning solutions on estimating camera poses with Structure-from-Motion (SfM), most notable being the recent transformer-based architecture called Dust3r. Accurate camera extrinsics/intrinsics are a necessary step before doing high-quality 3D and 4D reconstruction of the scenes. However, one area of 4D reconstruction remains unexplored, which is aligning of unsynchronized videos from various cameras sources per timestep. The existing techniques require working with event-based signals or having the expensive hardware with strict camera specifications in special lab-like environments. With the introduction of Sync-NeRF and their time embeddings, we got one step closer to affordable 4D reconstruction on the unsynchronized videos. Additionally, Dust3r's output includes per-camera point clouds accompanied by per-pixel confidence scores for synchronized camera view matching. This opens a promising avenue for exploring how Dust3r's confidence scores could be used for turning unsynchronized camera videos to the synchronized ones. This project is difficult and thus can only be finished by students with high academic ability. Specific details: (a) Design component (b) Implementation component (a) Research component We will research whether and how confidence scores from Dust3r and VGGT can be used to estimate frame timestep overlap between the different unsynchronized videos. We will use currently existing panoptic datasets in lab-like and in-the-wild environments to see how good these confidence scores work over multiple environments and across how many timesteps. Research should include intentionally making time offsets in videos and seeing how well do Dust3r/VGGT confidence scores predict timestep overlaps between the camera views and what are the final 4DGS reconstructions. (b) Development component We should develop a metric for timestep overlapping per-frame and per-view.

These could help treat Alzheimer’s disease, improve memory recall and other cognitive outcomes in people. However, having light, audio or vibration stimulation near 40Hz can be uncomfortable to experience; imagine that 40 Hz light flashes would be seen as strobe lighting. In this project, the aim is to develop devices that could produce such 40 Hz light but in micro/nano-second bursts that humans cannot consciously perceive, in what we can call “subliminal” stimulation. To test if the device could work in stimulating 40 Hz brain rhythms, we would record the user’s brain activity using a wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) headset while exposed to the subliminal stimulation through the device and study if there are neurological responses to the stimuli. We would also perform further analysis on whether we see higher activity of 40 Hz gamma rhythms in the brain.

878,CCDS25-0910,Prompt Engineering for Improving the Performance of Large Language Model,"Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT and Claude is the most talked about AI breakthrough in computer science in recent years, and they are actually have influence on many sides of our life. To use a LLM, one should first give it a paragraph of text or even images/audios, which are called prompts, and then the LLM will respond to your prompts. With different prompts, LLM can give different answers. Here is an interesting example that when you ask LLM the same question with different prompts, the quality of the answer it gives may vary, for example, when you give more detailed description of your task, LLM may give more accurate answers. It has been proven that LLMs have the ability called in-context learning, which means that LLMs do not need addtional training but can leverage information from prompts in a zero-shot manner. Therefore, how to get better prompts is another open research topic to fully explore the ability of LLMs. In this project, you can choose one of the sides to do a deep research. You can either try to build better prompts that will help the LLMs perform better. You can use the language logic-based approaches like DAN v2.0 or the optimisation-based approaches.

This technique is promising especially in this era of Large-scale Models. Pretrain or fintuning of big model like GPT with huge amount of data is quite a consumption. With the help of dataset distillation, companies can save a lot of money when training a large model and individuals may also be able to train and design their own large models in the future. For this project, we will focus on the DD for visual data, i.e. images. Existing DD methods have several main limitations,. In particular most of the DD methods just generate a set of synthetic data specific to a particular type of deep neural network, which means the synthetic data has limited cross domain abilities. For example, one set of distilled synthetic data can only works will on VGG16 but works badly on ResNet series network. What’s more, with the rising of transformers, attention mechanism has been thought as a strong feature extraction method, and could this be used to combine information in data? Therefore, DD is still a new and open research topic and here are a lot of interesting things to be found. In this project, you can choose one or two of the above questions to explore in depth, and you will write codes and do experiments to verify your conjectures and see the results.

Therefore, how to allow different individuals to jointly train a well-performing global model using the data they have is an urgent problem. Federated Learning has been a new and promising solution for distribution learning recent years. Not only does it need fewer communication rounds to converge compared to the gradient-merging based algorithm, but also it keeps the privacy of raw data of each participates. Therefore, federated learning has been a great choice for different entities that need to collaborate with each other to train a global model that performs better than each local model. Now the most popular Federated Learning algorithm is the model-average based like FedAvg. However, when facing non-i.i.d (none independent identical distribution) data, model-average based algorithms suffer from great performance degradation. One conjecture is that merging all the local models at once may lead to severe parameter changes and destroys the knowledge space of each local model, leading to the bad performance of the global model. Is it possible to do the merging step by step and will this help the algorithm to be more stable and get higher accuracy? In this project, you will try to investigate combining federated learning algorithms with incremental learning ideas to get a federated learning algorithm that is more robust and performs better under non-i.i.d data distributions. To better fulfill your goal, you may refer to deep learning techniques like knowledge distillation, dataset distillation and even get use of the pretrained large models.

This involves understanding the underlying mechanisms of how these models process different types of input data and identifying the points at which subtle alterations can lead to misclassification or other forms of misbehavior. For instance, this could involve creating a slightly altered image that causes the model to misinterpret the content or inserting inaudible noise into an audio clip that confuses the model's perception of spoken words. Throughout the project, you will be tasked with generating physical adversarial examples, testing their effectiveness on state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs, and analyzing the results. This work requires a solid foundation in machine learning, particularly in the areas of adversarial machine learning and the principles of multimodal data processing. Familiarity with programming languages such as Python and experience with deep learning frameworks like PyTorch would be beneficial. The specific goals and scope of the project can be adjusted based on your academic interests and expertise.

887,CCDS25-0919,Detect Audio Deepfake by Physical Probe - II,"Audio Deepfake has become increasingly sophisticated, posing significant risks in various scenarios, particularly in the context of telephone fraud. These fabricated audio recordings can convincingly mimic someone's voice, making it difficult to distinguish between real and fake voices. The existing detection methods focus on passively detecting synthetic traces in audio to distinguish the true and fake audio. However, with the advancement of Deepfake technology, this approach will be caught in an endless cycle of arms race with the evolving attack techniques. To address this challenge, in this project, we intend to explore a novel approach that leverages the unique interaction between a smartphone's vibration mechanism and the recording of speech. Our method involves actively triggering a vibration sound effect on the phone during a call. When the phone vibrates, it subtly affects the acoustic environment, creating slight but discernible differences in how real human speech and synthesized speech respond to the vibrations. By analyzing these subtle differences, our system can accurately determine whether the audio being recorded is from a real person or a Deepfake. During the project, you are supposed to trigger the vibration sound effect of the smartphone, collect the audio data and analyze the data to determine the difference of the true and fake voice. So, you are required to understand the basic knowledge of Deepfake and the physical principles of sound. Python programming experience would be a plus. The exact target will be tailored to your interests. Specific details: (a) Design component Physical probe given the understanding of audio deepfake.

889,CCDS25-0921,Radio-Frequency (RF) Sensing for Deep Awareness of Human Physical Status - Part I,"Human physical status is a rather broad concept; it includes, among others, behaviors (e.g., laughing and crying), vital signs (e.g., respiration and heart beat), as well as gestures and gaits. Conventionally, being aware of all these aspects require a very diversified types of sensors, for example, electrocardiogram (ECG) for heat beat measurements and video analysis for gait recognition. Recently, there is a trend of unifying all these sensing task into a single sensor based on Radio-Frequency (RF, e.g., WiFi), driven by the last development of signal processing and deep learning techniques. In particular, special type of RF sensors are developed main for such integrated tasks, which will be used by our project. In this project, we intend to explore these newly available RF sensors. Essentially, we first need to gather a large amount of sensing data on human physical status, ranging from gesture/behavior to vital signs. Then we develop deep learning modules and train them to recognize various human physical statuses out of seemingly wild RF signals. If time allows and if we get a big team on this project, we could also extend the objective to sentimental analysis based on RF sensing. In this project, you are supposed to use the most up-to-date RF sensors: we collect sensing data first and then we apply standard deep data analytics upon these data. So you are required to understand the basic concept of RF, and some basic knowledge of machine learning/data analytics would be a plus. For different parts of this project, we will focus on different human physical statuses. The exact target will be tailored to your interests.
